Project Overview:
In this project, youâ€™ll build an NLP-based system that automatically analyzes customer feedback across various channels (e.g., reviews, social media, surveys) to classify sentiment, detect trending topics, and extract actionable insights. This system can help businesses understand customer sentiments in real-time, respond to issues faster, and make data-driven decisions to improve customer experience.
